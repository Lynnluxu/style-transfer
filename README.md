Style transfer project with Lille pictures

Download this repo and upload it to your Google Drive.

/!\ Don't forget to change the execution type to GPU /!\

All notebooks need to be executed through the google colab platform to work, just execute the first cell to connect the notebook to your drive.

In the data folder, there is a folder for the content and the styles, just fill them with the data you want to work with.

You can find a cell that will download images of Lille for you in the "content" folder - but you can also import any image you want.

In the VGG16 and resnet notebooks, it is also style transfer but made with different models

The style-matrix notebook allows to render a matrix of style-content combinations using style transfer - useful when you want to try a lot of different styles and content.
