In order to obtain a better generated image, trial and error using different combinations for content and style layers as well as hyperparameters (learning rate, content weight, and style weight) is needed.\n",

I have determned the generate image is the most appealing, but someone else may say it is not because they find one of the other generated images more appealing.  In addition, if using a diferent content or style image, it is likely these paramers will not yield be the best generated image (for me)."
